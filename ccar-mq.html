          <p>Charlie's Chance Animal Rescue was my final assignment for my first college course at DCCC. The content, design, and subject were all my own choices. With only a few specific requirements, this first project was a challenge. We did not use frameworks, simply media queries and a little bit of Flexbox. It taught me to prefer doing work the hard way. My coding experience prior to college was a Codeacademy Intensive Freelance Developer program, in addition to other free Codeacademy courses and working on Wordpress for local organizations. Creating Charlie's Chance Animal Rescue proved to be a challenge and an inpiration, a conformation of the wisdom of my new choice to become a developer.</p>
            <p>To call it a pet project would not be too far off. The inspiration was simple: to honor my dog Charlie who had passed away that May. It is certainly far from perfect, but as my first project, where I learned and healed, I will always be proud of it.</p>

    <h2>Early Draft: Wireframes</h2>
      <p>As an artist with years of experience in drawing, charcoal, watercolor, as well as some work with Photoshop using a tablet, the wireframe process was very simple. These images show my original design before modification, but the structure remained consistent, just with some different content.</p>

      <p>For the same reason, choosing a color palette was natural and intuitive. As an animal rescue, warm earthy tones were a natural choice. Green is a common color on non-profit websites, so it seemed to be a natural fit. The palette also mimics the painting and photo of my dog Charlie.</p>
